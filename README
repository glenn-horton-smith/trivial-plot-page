This is a simple tool for manually maintaining a simple set of web
pages listing available plots and other "data representations" for a
scientific collaboration.  It requires the plots to be stored in a
Doc-DB instance, and creates web pages as a "friendly" index layer.
This was originally created as a proof-of-concept for providing a
minimal plot index page for MicroBooNE.

Doc-DB is a separate product.  For information on Doc-DB, see
http://docdb-v.sourceforge.net/.

This simple software tool has to be run manually when it is desired to
update the page.  It also requires that the relevant files in the
Doc-DB "document" follow the following naming convention:

    (plotname1).(ext1)
    (plotname1)_caption.txt
    (plotname2).(ext2)
    (plotname2)_caption.tex
    (plotname3).(ext3a)
    (plotname3).(ext3b)
    (plotname3)_caption.txt
    (other files without captions -- ignored)

Any file without a ``_caption.txt`` or ``_caption.tex`` caption file
will be ignored by the tool and not included on the generated web page.
